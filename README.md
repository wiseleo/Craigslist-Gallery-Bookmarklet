##### This bookmarklet and stylesheet add missing features to Craigslist Gallery View

Craigslist hides the date in Gallery view by setting

    .toc.grid #toc_rows .date {
    display: none;
    }
I think that is annoying, so I made a stylesheet based on this bookmarklet https://gist.github.com/mazuhl/392141 to make it visible again.
